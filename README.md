Puzzle game for Android - Shikaku

This project is based on developing puzzle games for Android platforms. The game chosen for this particular project is known as ‘Shikaku’. This game is mainly based on a grid blocking system. The grid will be divided mainly into a number of sub-grid blocks. These sub-grid blocks will be numbered by a number in a cell of the sub-grid giving the player a hint of the shape of the sub-grid. The player will have to block the sub-grid by only looking and guessing at the sequence of numbers in the cells.
By guessing and blocking one sub grid at a time, the player is supposed to block the entire grid without leaving any cells empty to win the game.
The player is not supposed to block other sub-grids, sequenced by other numbered cells while blocking one sub-grid.
If a player does invade other sub-grid while blocking, then the game will not be completed because the other sub-grids will not be able to be blocked, as cells won’t be available for blocking.
Tools: Eclipse Classic with ADT plug-in.


Recommended:
•	A ‘Scoreboard’ system which allows the player to compete against other players based on the highest scorer. This scoring system can be based on time for completion of the task or progression in completion of the task or both. This will also allow the user to store their name against their score on a scoreboard. Top 10 scores will be stored.
•	A 'Save & Resume' feature which should allow a player to abandon a partially solved game at any point of time and return to the game to continue from the point where it was left off earlier.
•	A 'Hint' functionality which allows the player to request for the next prospective move.


Optional:
•	User-defined table dimension setting which allows the player to set the dimension of the table as the player wishes, with an algorithm to auto sequence the numbers for the puzzle for the set dimension.
•	User defined table dimension setting with user defined sequencing of numbers to help create a fully customised puzzle game. And an algorithm to check the validity of the sequencing of the numbers to help the user build better puzzles.
•	A fully functional stand-alone application with all the above mentioned functionalities for android tablets.
